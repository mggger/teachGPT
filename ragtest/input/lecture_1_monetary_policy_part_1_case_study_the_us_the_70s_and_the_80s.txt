•  Positive correlation between inflation and unemployment in  the 70s and 80s; high inflation AND high unemployment

•  High inflation in the 70s due to oil shocks 

•  It led to the appointment of “tough” central banker: Paul  Volker.

•  He fought inflation and gained “credibility” for the Fed

•  Volker increased interest rates (tightened monetary policy) at  the cost of deep recession

•  This helped anchor inflation expectations at low levels but at  the cost of a severe recession
