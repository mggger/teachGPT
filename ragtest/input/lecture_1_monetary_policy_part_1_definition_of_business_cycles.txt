Loose definition  

•  A cycle is made of an expansion (boom) and a  contraction (recession)  

•  During the expansion all good things tend to go up (GDP,  employment, productivity, …), or grow faster than  “normal”, and bad things tend to fall (unemployment)  

•  During the contraction good things go down and bad  things go up
