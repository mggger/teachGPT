lecture_1_monetary_policy_part_1.md - Long Run Fluctuations are Driven by Supply Side Shocks (extra slide)

• In the long run, prices and wages are fully flexible and only supply side  shocks matter (TFP)  

What about  demand shocks ?  

• In the long run,  demand shocks are irrelevant since all factors of production  are employed at  full capacity  and the economy cannot produce more in  response to higher demand. In the long run, prices and wages are fully  flexible and demand shocks only drive up prices (generate inflation)  without increasing output  

…Hence monetary policy in the long run cannot affect real output growth  and other real variables  

In the short run, demand  shocks/printing  money matter  

If there is a demand shock, in the short  run firms can respond in two ways  

Adjust production  

Change prices  

How much they do of each depends whether the  economy is in a boom or recession
