lecture_2_monetary_policy_part_2.md - Forward Guidance and Time Inconsistency

Time Inconsistency – CBs have the incentive to break their  promise of keeping rates low in the future if inflation exceeds  its target – i.e. what CBs say now their policy rate will be in  the future might be  inconsistent  with the actual policy rate they  end up choosing  

If markets don’t believe the CB due to this time inconsistency,  there will be little or no impact on long term rates when the  statement is made  

Important that the CB sticks to promises –  otherwise forward  guidance less effective in the future (people are smart!).
