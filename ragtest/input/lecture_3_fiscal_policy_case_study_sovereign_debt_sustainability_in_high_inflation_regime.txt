lecture_3_fiscal_policy.md - Case Study: Sovereign Debt Sustainability in High  Inflation Regime

“Inflating away” the debt is a double-edged sword  

• Inflating away the sovereign debt is not a great solution and is a  temporary solution at best  

• After a certain point, “inflating away” the debt can no longer be used  as a way to decrease the sovereign  debt to GDP as the old long-term  debt, issued at low yields, expires, and it has to be rolled over at  higher nominal rates  

• The economy is left only with higher inflation which might require  higher interest rates for longer set by Central Banks and, as a result,  the cost of sovereign borrowing will increase even further.
