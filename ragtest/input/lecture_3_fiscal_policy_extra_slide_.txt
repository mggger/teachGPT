• While low labor/income taxes lead to low distortions they don’t produce much  revenue  

• But do high labor/income taxes necessarily produce high revenue? – depends  on which side of the Laffer curve a country is on  

• High tax rates on earned income discourage productive effort because of  supply side effects and shrink the tax base  

• If high labor tax levied on employers instead of workers, can lead to higher  unemployment which also shrinks the tax base  

• The overall effect of tax changes on  revenue is given by the change in the  labor tax base times the change in the income tax rate
