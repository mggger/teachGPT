lecture_3_fiscal_policy.md - Is there a threshold above which debt is not sustainable?

Historically, very few countries sustained high levels of debt to GDP  (above   $90\%$   or so) but countries differ.  

Factors to consider: 1) Who holds the debt (Japan)  

2) Ability of the government to collect taxes  

3) What are the implicit government guarantees (low official debt to  GDP but high implicit government guarantees can be bad too)  

4) Last, but not least, the key variables that determine the debt  sustainability of a country are given in the theory of Debt  Sustainability (see the following slides)
