$$
\Delta s_{t+1}^{i,\oint}=\alpha+\beta\left(i_{t}^{j}-i_{t}^{\oint}\right)+\epsilon_{t+1}^{1}
$$  

$s_{t+1}^{i,\mathbb{S}}$   $i$

• Quarterly Data

• Currencies with higher interest rate, on average, appreciate rather than depreciate for many currency pairs – regression coefficients are negative rather than 1 (violates UIRP)

• Results not statistically significant

• Almost none of the exchange rate variation explained by period t interest rate differentials (low  $\mathsf{R}^{\wedge}2$  )
