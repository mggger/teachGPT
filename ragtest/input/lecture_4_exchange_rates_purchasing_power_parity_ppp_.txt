lecture_4_exchange_rates.md - •  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

–  the same good (basket of goods) should sell for the same  price wherever it is sold (after converting into common  currency).  

•  PPP  holding imply that the RER is always equal to 1 !   $\begin{array}{r}{R E R^{U K}=\frac{e*P^{p o u n d}}{P^{e u r o}}=1)\;(\mathrm{every~strong}\;)}\end{array}$  ) (very strong prediction) Why would we expect PPP to hold? (extra slide)  

If PPP does not hold, there is arbitrage in the goods market  

•  If the price for the same good is lower in the UK relative to the  Eurozone, one can buy the good in the UK and export it to the  Eurozone  

•  This will increase the price of the good in the UK due to lower  supply of the good and decrease the price in the Eurozone due  to larger supply  

And/or  pound sterling will appreciate since there will be  higher demand for pounds in order to purchase the good in the  UK
