• Some governments intervene in exchange rate markets to decrease the volatility  of their exchange rate and prevent their currency from appreciating  

Example: yen/dollar  

¥/\$   – yen per one dollar 𝑒𝑒  

In order to depreciate the yen, the government “prints” yen and purchases  dollars – increases the supply of yen and increases the demand for dollars (US  government debt)  

• China and Japan – the two main holders of US Treasure Bonds due to currency  market interventions
