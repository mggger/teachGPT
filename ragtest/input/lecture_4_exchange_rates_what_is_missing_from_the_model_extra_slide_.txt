Compensation for risk – returns from the carry trade crash  when investors need money – positive beta (example: financial  crisis)

The UIRP theory assumes that investors are risk neutral (don’t  care about risk) – unrealistic assumption

However, even if we assume that investors dislike risk but  have constant currency risk premium, still cannot match the  data

In order to match the data, currency risk premium must be  time varying and correlated with period t interest rate  differentials

Understanding how and why those two variables co-move is  crucial in order to understand exchange rates
