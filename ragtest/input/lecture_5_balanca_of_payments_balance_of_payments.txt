•  Balance of Payment:  

CA  +  KA  = 0  

KA= (I – S) + (G –T) CA=TB+NFI  

Example  

–  Assume net foreign income is 0  

–  If the trade balance is negative, in the current period, the residents  and the government consume more than they produce (import more  than they export) and CA&lt;0  

–  In order to be able to purchase these foreign goods, the residents  and/or the government need to borrow from foreigners  (i.e. negative  CA has to be offset by positive KA)
