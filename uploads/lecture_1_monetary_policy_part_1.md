# Definition of Business Cycles  

Loose definition  

•  A cycle is made of an expansion (boom) and a  contraction (recession)  

•  During the expansion all good things tend to go up (GDP,  employment, productivity, …), or grow faster than  “normal”, and bad things tend to fall (unemployment)  

•  During the contraction good things go down and bad  things go up

What drives the business cycle?  

• Business cycles are driven by supply  and demand shocks  

• Definitions of aggregate supply and  demand shocks  

# What is aggregate demand?  

# Examples of Aggregate Demand Shocks  

Aggregate Demand  can therefore fluctuate because of:  

• preference shocks  –  people want to spend more/less of given  income without changes in interest rates  –  keeping up with the  Joneses ( C )  

• Entrepreneurs feel more/less buoyant and want to invest  more/less without changes in interest rates (“animal spirits”) – for  example tech bubble in the 1990s ( I )  

• Government increases expenditure ( G )  

•  Income taxes ( C )  

• Overseas demand increases ( X-I )  

• Changes in money supply (change in interest rates) due to  monetary policy– can affect all components

# What is aggregate supply?  

Examples of Aggregate Supply Shocks Aggregate Supply  can therefore fluctuate because of  

• Changes in demographics  • Labor union shocks • Corporate taxes • Oil shocks • Technology (TFP) shocks  

In general, any shock that affects the production  technology of firms is a supply shock; if not a  permanent shock, it is considered a driver of the  business cycle rather than potential output

# Efficiency of Business Cycles  

•  Business cycles are inefficient  

•  The solution to this problem is for the government to  manipulate demand in the economy using monetary  and fiscal policy tools  

•  We will study exactly how policy makers can use  monetary and fiscal policy  to “smooth” the business  cycle

# What is monetary policy?  

Central Bank’s objectives –  Price stability –  “Full” employment  

–  Might also include exchange rate stability &  financial stability (especially true after the 2008  financial crisis)  

•  ECB mandate – price stability  

Federal Reserve mandate – both price stability  and “full” employment  

# What is monetary policy cont.?  

Policy instruments  

•  Conventional Monetary Policy –  Short-term interest rates –  cutting interest rates is the  same as increasing the money supply and the other way  round

 •  Unconventional Monetary Policy –  Quantitative easing  and  forward guidance  (target longterm interest rate)  

Monetary policy is the use of conventional and  unconventional policies to achieve the objectives of the   Central Bank  – price stability and “full” employment

# The Island Story  

Monetary policy affects real growth in  the short run but not in the long run  

![](https://lblc.cc/ab879bd7007ed8c910ecccd16b97573a43aa3139c2b9fe75f7a9875357dae152.jpg)

# Aggregate Supply Curve  

Shape of aggregate supply curve depends on the extent of  price stickiness  

In the short run, prices and wages are sticky   – firms willing  to produce any quantity for the same price up to a point  

In the long run, prices and wages are fully flexible  – the  economy is at potential output – all the resources in the  economy are fully employed, cannot increase production for  any price

Even if prices are higher,  firms cannot produce more  because the economy is at a  In the long run, demand  shocks, such as cutting rates  (printing money), only affect  

# Long Run Fluctuations are Driven by Supply Side Shocks (extra slide)  

• In the long run, prices and wages are fully flexible and only supply side  shocks matter (TFP)  

What about  demand shocks ?  

• In the long run,  demand shocks are irrelevant since all factors of production  are employed at  full capacity  and the economy cannot produce more in  response to higher demand. In the long run, prices and wages are fully  flexible and demand shocks only drive up prices (generate inflation)  without increasing output  

…Hence monetary policy in the long run cannot affect real output growth  and other real variables  

In the short run, demand  shocks/printing  money matter  

If there is a demand shock, in the short  run firms can respond in two ways  

1. Adjust production  

2. Change prices  

How much they do of each depends whether the  economy is in a boom or recession

recession

# What happens in the short run if there is a  positive demand shock? (extra slide)  

In a recession, output increases a lot and inflation is low  

• In a recession, lots of spare capacity. Firms hire more workers (make workers work  overtime) and run machines for longer hours to meet higher demand. Since there is  spare capacity wages and input good prices do not increase much; i.e. no or small  increase of the marginal cost.  

• Firms do not increase prices by much  

In a boom, output increases a little (or not at all) and inflation is high  

• The smaller the spare capacity is (the lower unemployment is), the more firms  respond by increasing prices rather than by increasing output since it’s hard to find  new workers to employ and all workers work overtime, thereby demanding higher  wages. Similarly machines are used at full capacity. Also commodity and other  input goods’ prices increase in a boom. i.e. the marginal cost will increase.  

….Therefore, expansion ary monetary  policy (or positive demand shocks in  general) increase real output in the short run if the economy is in a recession – i.e.  there are real effects of monetary policy on the economy  

# Key Insight  

Since monetary policy is like a demand shock, in  normal times, it can easily offset demand-driven  recessions – for example, recessions driven by  lower consumer or investor demand  

![](https://lblc.cc/30aaeed4f24b8de74f53a005bce0a9c1f9fbf0073915963a736add0b7e18c5fe.jpg)  

# Monetary policy in simple terms (Your  guide to the FT!)  

When the economy is in a demand driven recession – the CB  engages in  loose/expansion ary  monetary policy --  decreases  interest rates (increases money supply)  which stimulates  investment, consumption and  boosts GDP growth  and  increases inflation to its target level  

When the economy is in a demand driven boom  – the CB  engages in  tight/contraction ary  monetary policy –  increases  interest rates (decreases money supply)  which slows down  investment consumption and GDP growth - i.e. it stops the  economy from overheating - and  lowers the inflation rate  to its  target level Supply Shocks and Monetary Policy  

•  What about supply shocks? Can  

monetary policy “smooth” supply shock  driven business cycles?  

Demand and supply shocks imply  different co-movement of inflation and  output

# Case Study: The US – The 70s and the 80s  

•  Positive correlation between inflation and unemployment in  the 70s and 80s; high inflation AND high unemployment

 •  High inflation in the 70s due to oil shocks 

 •  It led to the appointment of “tough” central banker: Paul  Volker.

 •  He fought inflation and gained “credibility” for the Fed

 •  Volker increased interest rates (tightened monetary policy) at  the cost of deep recession

 •  This helped anchor inflation expectations at low levels but at  the cost of a severe recession  

# Interim Summary  

•  Monetary policy cannot affect real GDP in the very  long run (only supply side shocks can)  

If business cycle fluctuations are driven by  demand  shocks , in normal times, the Central Bank CAN  achieve its mandate of price stability and full  employment using the tools at hand  

If business cycle fluctuations are driven by  supply  shocks , in normal times, the Central Bank CANNOT  achieve its mandate

# The Taylor Rule  

# i = [r +  π∗]  + a \*( π  –  π∗ ) + b\*(output gap)  

i  is the target nominal rate (for example FED Funds rate in the  US)  

•  π  and  π∗  are the realized and target inflation rates     r  is the target real rate (determined by potential real GDP)  

a>0  and  b>0  are parameters which capture how much the CB  cares about inflation stability and the output gap  

The higher  a  is relative to  b , the more the CB cares about  inflation stability relative to the  output gap  

# The Taylor Rule  

Ben Bernanke and John Taylor – Two competing specifications  lead to two completely different interpretations  (see “ The Taylor  Rule: A benchmark for monetary policy? ” by Ben Bernanke, 2015)

# Summary  

•  Business cycles are driven by supply and demand shocks  

•  Monetary policy  

–  is conducted by Central Banks –  consists of the use of instruments to stabilize inflation and  achieve “full” employment  

•  Monetary policy can “smooth” demand shocks but not supply  shocks when policy rates aren’t at the zero lower bound  

•  Monetary policy affects real variables in the short run but not  in the long run  

•  CBs’ policy can be captured by a Taylor Rule
