# Monetary Policy Implementation  

REMINDER: Central Banks achieve their mandate of  stable inflation and full employment by manipulating  demand  

• Main instrument  –  a policy interest rate  

Prior to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, Central  Banks conducted monetary policy by manipulating  short term interest rates  –  “conventional monetary  policy”  

With the onset of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and  short term interest rates hitting the zero lower bound,  Central Banks started targeting  long term interest  rates  --  “unconventional monetary policy”  

# Monetary Policy Implementation  

•  CBs use other instruments too to ensure that  lower/higher policy rates transmit to the real economy  by generating more/less lending:  

# Examples:  

• Liquidity provision ( Lender of Last Resort ) to  financial institutions during crises ensures that banks  are in “good health” and willing to lend

 • Financial regulation that ensures that banks don’t take  excessive risk and remain in “good health”  

# The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)

# Challenges posed by the ZLB  

•  In order to get the economy out of the deep  recession triggered by the 2008 global financial  crisis,  CBs needed to set very negative policy  rates – remember the Taylor rule  

•  The presence of cash precluded them from doing  that – hence the ZLB constraint on policy rates  

•  Response of Central Banks – reliance on  unconventional monetary policy: Quantitative  Easing (QE) and Forward Guidance

# Unconventional Monetary Policy  

–  Quantitative easing:   Purchases of …  

•  long term government bonds •  other long-term financial assets (mortgage backed securities,  corporate debt)  

Main Goal – To lower long-term rates to stimulate borrowing,  consumption and investment  

Higher demand for bonds increases their price and lowers their yield –  i .

# Summary:  Implementation of  Unconventional Monetary Policy -- QE  

•  QE is the purchases of long-term bonds and assets (primarily  government bonds) by the CB which increases the demand for  these assets, lowers their yields/increases their prices  

•  However, as there are many other sources of supply and demand  for these long-term assets, it is hard for CBs to try to target the  long-term interest rate directly (as it was the case for short term  rates such as interbank market rates), which is why they chose to  target the quantity of long-term assets they purchased (i.e. they  target the size of the CB’s balance sheet)  

•  In that sense, QE is a much less precise instrument than  conventional MP as the interest rate is what matters for credit  demand  

# What are the Channels Through Which  QE Affects the Real Economy?  

#  “Portfolio-Rebalancing”/ “Reaching for yield”  channel  

• By purchasing government bonds, the CB bids up prices/lowers the yields of government  debt. Investors chase higher yields (“reach for yield”) and invest into the next safest asset  class such as AAA corporates, which lowers the yield on AAA corporate debt making it  cheaper for safe corporates to issue debt and invest; Investors who used to hold AAA  corporate debt move to junk bonds or equity etc --- thus this portfolio rebalancing effect  makes the government debt CB purchases indirectly affect the prices of all asset classes.

 • CBs also directly purchased AAA corporate debt which stimulated the economy in a  similar fashion.  

#  Bank lending channel  

Lower rates lead to more bank lending  

#  Bank balance sheet channel  

By purchasing non liquid/non safe assets from banks, CBs removed illiquid/risky assets  from the banks’ balance sheet freeing up “valuable” bank capital (due to binding  minimum bank capital requirements) to be used for new loans  

# What are the Channels Through Which  QE Affects the Real Economy?  

#  Sovereign debt sustainability channel  

• By lowering government debt yields, the CB makes it cheaper for  governments to borrow and decreases the probability of sovereign debt crisis  (Europe)  

#  External demand channel/Exchange rate channel  

• Lowering long term yields depreciated the Euro (similarly to lowering short  term rates), which leads to higher external demand and growth

What are the key channels through which  Quantitative Easing stimulated the economy post  the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/European  Sovereign debt crisis of 2011?  

Are the channels the same for Europe vs the US? Context: financial crisis, US has more developed capital markets  than Europe; sovereign debt crisis in Europe

# GFC was a negative demand shock; thus, the optimal  monetary policy response can be depicted as  

expansion ary monetary policy (QE)   $^+$   programs that ensure the transmission of low interest rates to borrowers  worked as a positive demand shock to offset the negative demand shock

# Unconventional Monetary Policy  

–  Forward Guidance:  

• The Central Bank promises to keep  future  policy rates at a given  level in an attempt to lower long term rates  

Link between short term and long term rates  – long term safe  rates are approximately equal to the average sum of  expected future policy rates  

# Example of Forward Guidance  

FED statement on August 9, 2011:  

“The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant  exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”

# Forward Guidance and Time Inconsistency  

Time Inconsistency – CBs have the incentive to break their  promise of keeping rates low in the future if inflation exceeds  its target – i.e. what CBs say now their policy rate will be in  the future might be  inconsistent  with the actual policy rate they  end up choosing  

If markets don’t believe the CB due to this time inconsistency,  there will be little or no impact on long term rates when the  statement is made  

Important that the CB sticks to promises –  otherwise forward  guidance less effective in the future (people are smart!).

# Summary  

• At the ZLB, CBs rely on unconventional monetary policy to smooth the  business cycle  

• Unconventional MP is much less effective than conventional MP due to  CBs’ inability to precisely set long term rates the way they can set short  term rates  

• QE can impact the economy via alternative channels than just the standard  bank lending channel  

• Forward guidance efficiency can be reduced due to time inconsistency
