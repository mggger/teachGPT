•  Common international pattern of increasing government spending although level of spending varies across  countries  

# Public spending growth in early-industrialised countries was largely  driven by social spending

# Why do we need the government to  step in?  

1)    Under-provision of  public goods  due to “free riding” (for ex.  “law and order”,  defence )  

• Agents have an incentive to  “free ride”  and not pay for the production of such goods; hence the role for  government provision of such goods.  

2)    Public goods provide  large positive external i ties  (for ex.  education, health case,  infrastructure )  

3)      Advantage in providing insurance contracts:  cost of insurance against  unemployment, sickness and disability lower if everyone forced to participate (in  private markets selective participation – “lemon’s” problem)  

4)     Re-distribution:  degree of redistribution from rich to poor depends on societies’  preferences. Examples of re distributive policies -  progressive taxation, free education,  free healthcare, subsidized pensions  etc

# Why Tax?  

# Two rationales  

•  To raise revenue – need to raise revenue to finance desired  government expenditure  

• To correct incentives  – market prices are socially undesirable  and need to be altered to improve outcomes -- e.g pollution  external it y   impose taxes on CO2 emissions

# Labor Tax Distortions  

•  High income taxes lead to a shrinking tax base –  People work less –  They spend their time trying to avoid tax –  Brightest/most talented people leave  

•  If on the right side of the Laffer curve, cutting taxes may  increase revenue (Reagan om ics)  

# Labor Tax Distortions  

# (extra slide)  

• While low labor/income taxes lead to low distortions they don’t produce much  revenue  

• But do high labor/income taxes necessarily produce high revenue? – depends  on which side of the Laffer curve a country is on  

• High tax rates on earned income discourage productive effort because of  supply side effects and shrink the tax base  

• If high labor tax levied on employers instead of workers, can lead to higher  unemployment which also shrinks the tax base  

• The overall effect of tax changes on  revenue is given by the change in the  labor tax base times the change in the income tax rate  

# Taxes on Capital

# Capital Tax Distortions (taxes on  

•  Higher corporate taxes imply that firms  

–  Move to countries with lower tax rates (countries enter a  “race to the bottom” trying to lower capital taxes to expan corporate tax base – bad equilibrium in terms of global tax  revenue from corporate taxation)  

–  Firms have higher incentives to engage in tax evasion  through offshores or don’t repatriate profits from abroad  

–  Capital is lower than its friction less optimal level (true for  any positive capital tax rate and the external it y is worse the  higher the tax rate is)  

# Regardless of the corporate tax rate, corporate tax revenue is a very small  fraction of GDP…

# Definition of Fiscal Deficit/Surplus  

•  Primary fiscal deficit =  expenditures - tax  revenue =  G-T  

•  Primary fiscal surplus = - Primary fiscal deficit  

•  General fiscal  deficit = Interest payment on  debt + Primary fiscal  deficit =  iD+(G-T)

# Primary vs General Fiscal  Deficit – Greece  

Difference between primary and general fiscal deficits is large  when countries are on the brink of sovereign debt crisis  

![](https://lblc.cc/2ff0e7c3e0f478b6d6e8ab0aef449b9e0d111112d4b2f5519022fea4adab775c.jpg)  

# Two main reasons why  primary  fiscal deficits change  over the business cycle  

Automatic Stabilise rs  

•  Tax revenue varies with the size of GDP

 •  Unemployment benefits rise in recessions  

Discretionary Policy  

•  Keynesian stimulus – increase spending and cut taxes in a  recession to increase demand 

 •  Political cycle often coincides with business cycle  

# Two main reasons why  primary  fiscal deficits change  over the business cycle (extra slide)  

Automatic Stabilise rs  

• As an economy expands and contracts so does the tax revenue.

 • Unemployment benefits rise in downturn and fall in booms.  Therefore, the deficit becomes larger in recessions and falls in a boom.  

Discretionary Policy  

In response to an economic slowdown the government may deliberately  choose to cut taxes and increase expenditure to jump start the economy  (Keynesian economics and the fiscal multiplier – see textbook for details).  This also makes the deficit higher in recessions  

• Political cycles also influence the primary deficits. Political decisions can  make the primary deficit either positively or negatively correlated with GDP  growth depending on policies  

# Sovereign/Government Debt  

No collateral since most countries will not invade  another country to seize the collateral in case of  default  

International courts historically didn’t exist or quite  weak  

# Why Can Countries Borrow?  

# Why Can Countries Borrow?  

# Main costs associated with non-repayment  

•  Exclusion from sovereign debt markets – cannot  smooth government consumption over time  

•  Trade sanctions  

Private sector borrowing cost and access to foreign  debt markets are highly correlated with sovereign  borrowing cost  

•  Banking crises tend to follow sovereign debt crises

# Is there a threshold above which debt is not sustainable?  

Historically, very few countries sustained high levels of debt to GDP  (above   $90\%$   or so) but countries differ.  

Factors to consider: 1) Who holds the debt (Japan)  

2) Ability of the government to collect taxes  

3) What are the implicit government guarantees (low official debt to  GDP but high implicit government guarantees can be bad too)  

4) Last, but not least, the key variables that determine the debt  sustainability of a country are given in the theory of Debt  Sustainability (see the following slides)  

# Debt Sustainability  Theory  

Theory allows us to answer the following questions…  

1) How can we make government debt sustainable / i.e.  prevent the debt to GDP from exploding?  

2)  How large the debt to GDP of a country will be,  given the country’s macroeconomic conditions?  

# Government Debt Dynamics  

• Government Budget Constraint (assume only short-term debt/one period debt)  

$$
G_{t}-T_{t}+D_{t-1}^{S}=P_{t}^{S}D_{t}^{S}\;.
$$  

$D_{t}^{S}$   $t,$   $t+1$  

$G_{t}-T_{t}$   $P_{t}^{S}-$   $i_{t}^{S}-$   $t$   $\begin{array}{r}{P_{t}^{S}=\frac{1}{\big(1+i_{t}^{S}\big)}}\end{array}$  

$Y_{t}\,=\,\bigl(1+g_{t}\bigr)Y_{t}$  

# Debt to GDP Dynamics  

• Government Budget Constraint:  

$$
G_{t}-T_{t}+D_{t-1}^{S}=P_{t}^{S}D_{t}^{S}
$$  

• Divide by GDP and simplify:

# Sustainable Debt  

Debt is sustainable if Debt/GDP is not changing:

(1) Ratio rises because of interest payments  

(2) Ratio falls because of output growth  

(3) Ratio increases because of primary deficit

•  If                 , stabilizing the public debt to  GDP requires running primary surpluses  

•  If                 ,  one can run primary deficits and  still keep the debt to GDP on a sustainable path  

# Debt Sustainability - Summary  

• Shifts in interest rates,  i ,  and growth rates,  g ,  have big impact on government debt  dynamics  

Feedback loop: If  i  increases and higher  i leads to lower  g , then countries can rapidly  find their public finances deteriorating  

# Is it bad for a country to run a  deficit and accumulate more debt?  

The answer depends on …  

•  Whether the return on government “investment” is  higher than the cost of borrowing  

How much the new borrowing will increase the  probability of sovereign default in the future  

# Is it bad for a country to run a  deficit and accumulate more debt?  (extra slide)  

•  No if the money is invested and the return on the  investment is higher than the borrowing cost for the  government  

•  What is the return on the investment? – the higher  government tax revenue due to the investment. For  example, investing in education and infrastructure raises  GDP and the taxes collected in the future  

•  Even if money is used to fund government consumption – might be still beneficial during recessions to jump start the  economy – the fiscal multiplier (Keynes)

# Case Study: Sovereign Debt Sustainability in High  Inflation Regime  

High unanticipated inflation plus long-term standard debt  allow us to “inflate away” the debt  

![](https://lblc.cc/bb25aec0f8e3248273b884f8505259fc51a467ac50480903e46d8ca717369355.jpg)  

Case Study: Sovereign Debt Sustainability in High  Inflation Regime  

However, high inflation also led to higher policy rates, raising the cost of  future government debt  

Central Banks had to raise  real  rates to effectively fight inflation which  increased the  real  cost of borrowing for governments going forward; higher  rates might be here to stay

# Case Study: Sovereign Debt Sustainability in High  Inflation Regime  

“Inflating away” the debt is a double-edged sword  

• Inflating away the sovereign debt is not a great solution and is a  temporary solution at best  

• After a certain point, “inflating away” the debt can no longer be used  as a way to decrease the sovereign  debt to GDP as the old long-term  debt, issued at low yields, expires, and it has to be rolled over at  higher nominal rates  

• The economy is left only with higher inflation which might require  higher interest rates for longer set by Central Banks and, as a result,  the cost of sovereign borrowing will increase even further.

# Summary  

•  Government expenditure can be justified by market failure and  redistribution

 •  Income and capital taxes are distortion ary

 •  In order to address income and wealth inequality, we need to  redesign global capital taxation 

 •  Deficits can be justified if they are used for productive  purposes

 •  The key variables that determine sovereign debt sustainability  are: the level of debt to GDP, trajectory of deficits, cost of  

borrowing, GDP growth, maturity of sovereign debt and  implicit/explicit government guarantees
