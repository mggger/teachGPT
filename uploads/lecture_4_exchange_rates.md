# Competitiveness and Exchange  Rates  

•  Exchange Rate appreciation endangers competitiveness of  export sector  

# Example:  

In 2003, price of an apple in Brazil is 1 real, which implies that the price of  the same apple if imported in the US is .33 dollars (see previous slide)  

• In 2011, price of an apple in Brazil is 1 real, which implies that the price of  the same apple if imported in the US is .6 dollars  

Real appreciation decreases demand for Brazilian apples in the US and  hurts Brazilian exports  

Currency Market Intervention

# Exchange Rate Intervention by  

Governments  

Exchange rates are determined by  

# supply=demand  

• Some governments intervene in exchange rate markets to decrease the volatility  of their exchange rate and prevent their currency from appreciating  

Example: yen/dollar  

¥/\$   – yen per one dollar 𝑒𝑒  

In order to depreciate the yen, the government “prints” yen and purchases  dollars – increases the supply of yen and increases the demand for dollars (US  government debt)  

• China and Japan – the two main holders of US Treasure Bonds due to currency  market interventions

# Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIRP)  

The trade-off for a British investor  

• Imagine that you are a British investor who owns 1 pound in period  0 and can choose between one out of the two investment  strategies:  

![](https://lblc.cc/3d7144ef1ff1a31a655fb0ab3f1e42598d3ef6e89fcc79b4f9c7dfa5e1329db3.jpg)  

# Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIRP)  

The trade-off for a British investor  

$(1+i_{0})$   $(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{\epsilon}}$  

$e_{0}-t=0$  

$t=1$  

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{{\displaystyle\iff}}&{{\displaystyle(1+i_{0})}}&{{>}}&{{\displaystyle(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{\epsilon}}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\iff}}&{{\displaystyle(1+i_{0})}}&{{<}}&{{\displaystyle(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{\epsilon}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Trading  Strategy  

# Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIRP)  

The trade-off for a British investor  

$(1+i_{0})$   $(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{\epsilon}}$  

$e_{0}-t=0$  

$t=1$   $i_{0}$  

$\begin{array}{l l l}{{\displaystyle\mathrm{if}\ \left(1+i_{0}\right)}}&{{>}}&{{(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{e}}\ \mathrm{invert\in\UK\bond}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\mathrm{if}\ \left(1+i_{0}\right)}}&{{<}}&{{(1+i_{0}^{G})\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{e}}\ \mathrm{invert\in\Gett{Man}\ \backslash i_{0}\ \mathrm{.}}}}\end{array}$  

Trading  Strategy  

# UIRP  

$$
\begin{array}{l c l}{{\mathrm{~f~}\left(1+i_{0}\right)}}&{{>}}&{{(1+i_{0}^{G})\displaystyle\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{e}}\mathrm{~inverse~in~U~}}}\\ {{\mathrm{~f~}\left(1+i_{0}\right)}}&{{<}}&{{(1+i_{0}^{G})\displaystyle\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{e}}\mathrm{~inverse~in~G~}}}\end{array}
$$  

Given the strategy above, no arbitrage implies:  

$$
\frac{e_{0}}{e_{1}^{e}}=\frac{(1+i_{0})}{(1+i_{0}^{G})}
$$  

The UIRP theory predicts that the equality above holds  

# UIRP  

Testing UIRP implies testing the following two hypotheses:  

1. UIRP predicts that the currency with higher interest rate should  depreciate on average  

$$
\triangle\ln e_{1}^{e}=\ln e_{1}^{e}-\ln e_{0}=i_{0}^{G}-\imath
$$  

2.  UIRP predicts that there are no excess returns on average (the  expected excess return is zero) from borrowing in the country with low  interest rate and investing in the country with high interest rate  (this  investment strategy is known as the “carry” trade)  

# Does UIRP work? --- Testing Hypothesis 1  

$$
\Delta s_{t+1}^{i,\oint}=\alpha+\beta\left(i_{t}^{j}-i_{t}^{\oint}\right)+\epsilon_{t+1}^{1}
$$

• Quarterly Data

 • Currencies with higher interest rate, on average, appreciate rather than depreciate for many currency pairs – regression coefficients are negative rather than 1 (violates UIRP)

 • Results not statistically significant

 • Almost none of the exchange rate variation explained by period t interest rate differentials (low  $\mathsf{R}^{\wedge}2$  )

# What is Missing From the Model?  

Compensation for risk – returns from the carry trade are low  when investors need money – positive beta (example: financial  crisis)

# What is Missing From the Model?  

“Augmented” UIRP equation that takes into account  compensation for risk (the currency risk premium)  

The average profits from the carry strategy equal the currency  risk premium

Expected excess returns for a UK  investor from being long the UK  government bond and short the  German government bond  (average profits from carry trade)  

The Currency Risk Premium is a function of the covariance  of the carry returns with the  stock market, among other  things  

# What is Missing From the Model? (extra  slide)  

Compensation for risk – returns from the carry trade crash  when investors need money – positive beta (example: financial  crisis)

  The UIRP theory assumes that investors are risk neutral (don’t  care about risk) – unrealistic assumption

  However, even if we assume that investors dislike risk but  have constant currency risk premium, still cannot match the  data

  In order to match the data, currency risk premium must be  time varying and correlated with period t interest rate  differentials

  Understanding how and why those two variables co-move is  crucial in order to understand exchange rates

# Monetary Policy and Exchange Rates  (extra slide)  

• If period   $t$   relative interest rates failed to explain the future movement of the  exchange rate (between t and  $\mathsf{t}\!+\!1\,,$  ), then does monetary policy matter for exchange  rates?  

The answer is YES  –the relationship that matters is between  exchange rate changes  and  changes  in long term/short term interest rate differentials; in other words, it’s  period  $_{\dag+1}$   policy rates that drive the change in exchange rates between t and t+1  (optional: for details see  Stavrakeva and Tang (2015));  

Example: The theory predicts that if the FED increases its interest rate  relative to the ECB, the dollar will appreciate instantaneously against the  euro. This prediction is strongly confirmed by the data  

• Contrast with UIRP which links todays exchange rate change to past policy  rate

# Real Exchange Rate  

![](https://lblc.cc/d02becc780255eea4fd59537fa7471393241dc4fc58849f2b09459e7c5c80cd8.jpg)  

 If the price of goods in the UK is  0.91  times the price of the same goods in the  Eurozone (denominated in the same currency), then the UK   real exchange rate (against the EZ) is  0.91  

# Real Exchange Rate  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{R E R^{U K}=\frac{e*P^{p o u n d}}{P^{e u r o}}}\end{array}
$$  

•  e – nominal exchange rate;  euros per pound  

•  Higher e implies that the pound appreciates in nominal terms  and,  holding relative prices constant , the RER appreciates too  

𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

 •  Higher prices in the UK relative to the Eurozone, higher  𝑃𝑃   ,  𝑃𝑃 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 holding the nominal exchange rate constant , implies that the  real exchange rate appreciates  

# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)  

# •  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)  

–  the same good (basket of goods) should sell for the same  price wherever it is sold (after converting into common  currency).  

•  PPP  holding imply that the RER is always equal to 1 !   $\begin{array}{r}{R E R^{U K}=\frac{e*P^{p o u n d}}{P^{e u r o}}=1)\;(\mathrm{every~strong}\;)}\end{array}$  ) (very strong prediction) Why would we expect PPP to hold? (extra slide)  

If PPP does not hold, there is arbitrage in the goods market  

•  If the price for the same good is lower in the UK relative to the  Eurozone, one can buy the good in the UK and export it to the  Eurozone  

•  This will increase the price of the good in the UK due to lower  supply of the good and decrease the price in the Eurozone due  to larger supply  

And/or  pound sterling will appreciate since there will be  higher demand for pounds in order to purchase the good in the  UK  

# Why would PPP not hold in its strongest form?  

Transportation costs  

CPI baskets differ across countries  

Non Tradable Goods – the RER is usually calculated using  CPI index which contains both tradable and non-tradable  goods  (PPP will not hold for non-tradable goods since the price e qui lib rating  mechanism is due to the ability to trade the good)

# Relationship between nominal  

exchange rate changes and inflation  

•  Re-writing the PPP equation one can show that  

Changes in nominal exchange rate = inflation differential  

•  That is, if PPP holds (RER=1),  a country with relatively  lower inflation will see its nominal exchange rate  appreciate  

•  And the other way round!

# Summary  

•  Exchange rates are driven by supply=demand but also by no  arbitrage conditions (UIRP and PPP)  

No arbitrage condition  in asset markets --- UIRP theory ; the  UIRP theory is violated (we see positive returns from the carry  trade) but the violation is explained with compensation for risk  for “carry” since “carry” unravels in crisis times  

•  No arbitrage condition  in goods markets --- PPP theory; the  PPP holds in medium/long run but not in the short run
