# The Current Account (CA)  

GDP GNI  

=  C + I + G + (X-M)  

=  C + I + G + (X-M) + NFI

NFI  :   Net Foreign Income:  returns on the country’s assets  minus returns on the country’s liabilities  

# The Current Account (CA)  

•  GNI =  C + I + G +  CA  

•  GNI is total income of domestic residents. They either  consume it, save it or pay it as taxes: GNI=C + S + T  

•  Hence:  $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}+\mathrm{G}+\mathrm{CA}=\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{S}+\mathrm{T}$  

$\mathrm{range:CA}+\underset{\mathrm{\tiny~\textcent~}}{\underbrace{(\mathrm{I}\cdot\mathrm{S})+(\mathrm{G}\cdot\mathrm{T})}}=0$  

Private needs for funds  $+$   Public needs for funds  $=$  Total borrowing from foreigners  

# The Capital Account (KA)  

Definition:  

Total borrowing from foreigners = KA =  (I – S) + (G –T)  

How can a country borrow?  

•  Portfolio investment in the country (the  country sells debt or equity to foreigners) •  Foreign direct investment (FDI)  

# Balance Of Payments  

•  Balance of Payment:  

CA  +  KA  = 0  

KA= (I – S) + (G –T) CA=TB+NFI  

Example  

–  Assume net foreign income is 0  

–  If the trade balance is negative, in the current period, the residents  and the government consume more than they produce (import more  than they export) and CA<0  

–  In order to be able to purchase these foreign goods, the residents  and/or the government need to borrow from foreigners  (i.e. negative  CA has to be offset by positive KA)  

# Interpretation of the Capital  Account  

Examples  

–  Germany and Norway: negative KA (means net  savings) –  US: positive KA (means net borrowing)

# The Monetary Policy “Trilemma”

# The “Trilemma”  

Assumes UIRP holds  

Trilemma says that a country can have 2 out of 3 things but  never all 3  

For example, if the exchange rate is fixed and the capital  account is open, a country gives up its monetary policy  (example Eurozone countries or countries with currency pegs).  

Why? If the currency is pegged (or same currency), if interest  rates across countries differ, there will be infinite inflows by  investors trying to exploit the risk free arbitrage, up to the  point where inflation pressure skyrockets (unsustainable)  

Historical advice of IMF to emerging markets: in order to have  independent monetary policy and open capital account, allow  your currency to be free floating

C. International Dilemma  

# “Dilemma”, Not “Trilemma”  

If a country has a floating exchange rate (gives up exchange rate stability), still  it might be impossible to have independent monetary  policy as long as it has  an open capital account  

• Relatively higher domestic interest rate often leads to currency appreciation  rather than depreciation  (forward premium puzzle)  

• Expected currency appreciation leads to even more inflows, credit boom,  higher inflation and the CB increases interest rates to fight inflation even  more  

• This widens the interest rate gap, leading to even more inflows etc --  unsustainable cycle (example :  Brazil 2008-2011)  

# Why Was the “Trilemma”  wrong?  

•  The International Trilemma  incorrectly  assumes that  UIRP holds  

•  Recent research (Helene Rey – LBS faculty in  economics) -- impossible to have even 2 out of 3  

•   The theory of International “Dilemma”  

# “Dilemma”, Not “Trilemma”  

•  Many emerging markets complain that the US should  take other countries into account when forming  monetary policy ( Will it ever happen?)  

# •  Solution?  

–   Capital account controls on inflows when economy is  overheating  

# Summary  

The capital account is the flip side of the current account  

Large current account implies that the country is a net exporter and it’s a  net saver and the other way round; Large capital account implies the  country is a net borrower and the other way round  

The “Trilemma” says that a country can achieve only 2 out of 3 goals  (independent monetary policy, exchange rate stability, open capital  account)  

The “Dilemma” says that even if countries have floating exchange rates  they still do not have fully independent monetary policy if they have open  capital accounts. This is because the UIRP theory does not hold ; The  theory of the international “Dilemma” triggered shift in IMF policies
